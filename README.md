Features
Soil moisture sensing to determine when and how much to water.
Real-time monitoring of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
User-configurable settings for irrigation schedules and thresholds.
Automatic water pump control for precise watering.
Energy-efficient design for battery-powered operation.
Hardware Requirements
To build this Smart Irrigation System, you will need the following components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
Soil moisture sensor
Temperature and humidity sensor (e.g., DHT22)
Relay module or MOSFET for controlling water pump
Water pump and tubing
Power source (battery or AC adapter)
Jumper wires
Breadboard or custom PCB for circuit assembly
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Download Arduino IDE
Arduino libraries for sensors and actuators (installable via Arduino Library Manager)
Setup and Installation
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the Arduino IDE and ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (refer to libraries.txt or the project documentation for a list of required libraries).
Connect the hardware components according to the circuit diagram provided in the project documentation.
Open the main Arduino sketch (.ino file) in the Arduino IDE.
Configure the Arduino board type and port under the "Tools" menu.
Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
Power up the system and monitor the serial console for debugging information.
Usage
Ensure that the soil moisture sensor and environmental sensors are properly calibrated.
Set your desired irrigation schedule and moisture threshold values in the Arduino code.
Deploy the system in your garden or plant area.
The system will automatically monitor soil moisture and environmental conditions and water the plants as needed.
